## About

The Scripts correspond to colab notebooks which require the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), and they allow to get standardised drought indices using the gamma and log-logistic distibutions for rainfall and rainfal minus evapotranspiration, the z-scores for vegetation, and empirical probabilities based on the Gringorten plotting position for runoff.

</p>

These can be calculated from hydrometeorological gridded data stored in GEE, including CHIRPS for rainfall, a combination of variables to calculate evapotranspiration from ERA5 and FLDAS, NDVI from AVHRR and MODIS, and runoff from ERA5. However, other datasets can also be used.

Additionally, a python file for cross-correlation using prewhitened data with ARIMA was also included.
